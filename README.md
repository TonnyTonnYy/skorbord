Basketball scoring app
This web application was made due to a very simple reason : I organise basketball tournaments and decided to start keeping track of stats in a more digital fashion.

working demo : https://skorbord-app.herokuapp.com/ (#strongpassword : root)

This app is not much, codebase is pretty ugly, but it works !



I have some future developements in mind, to create complete system which will automate the tournament process : from team registration to defining a winner. It will take some time to develop, but is definietly going to save me time in the future.

In my little utopia inside my mind, I also have an idea to integrate it on the blockchain, host dApp od decentralized network and have autonomous tournament creator. Only time will show whether this idea decides to leave my head.
