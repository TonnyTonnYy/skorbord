# skorbord
Basketball scoring app made in React.

This web application was made due to a very simple reason : I organise basketball tournaments and decided to start keeping track of stats in a more digital fashion.

working demo : https://skorbord-app.herokuapp.com/ (#strongpassword : root)

# UI #
After login and choosing the game (arrow on the right), we are able to input stats for both teams.

The basic workflow is two people - one using tablet with the app runnig and fingers ready for input and the other one watching the game and telling the stats eg. Orange 2 Assist.

# Basic design concepts

Below are three main building blocks of my app
![alt text](https://github.com/TonnyTonnYy/skorbord/blob/master/layout.PNG?raw=true)
Later they are divided to smaller and smaller boxes which results in previously seen UI. Everything is done using CSS-grid, flexbox and some CSS rules.

What is more inside my project :
- React Components
- CSS variables
- RWD design aimed only at horizontal orientation
- Vanilla JS helpers
- basic backend (mongoDB + expressJS)
- puropsely weak security ( I had a tight deadline and was not afraid of an attack)


# Summary
This app is not much, codebase is pretty ugly, now I know I could have done it better, but it gets the job done ;D

If I were to rewrite this project I would have probably done it better, but I have a plan to develop a more complex app, where scoring will be one of the components.

I have some future developements in mind, to create complete system which will automate the tournament process : from team registration to defining a winner. It will take some time to develop, but is definietly going to save me time in the future.

In my little utopia inside my mind, I also have an idea to integrate it on the blockchain, host dApp od decentralized network and have autonomous tournament creator. Only time will show whether this idea decides to leave my head.

My favourite aspect of this app is the real-world usage, and how my coding skills helped me solve my problem.
